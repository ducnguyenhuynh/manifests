# Kubeflow Manifests

Forked from `https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/releases/tag/v1.4.1`

Because we encounter the error `Could not find CSRF cookie XSRF-TOKEN in the request` when creating notebook in the non-localhost IP. Therefore, I modified the repo based on the solution `https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/5803#issuecomment-848405891`
